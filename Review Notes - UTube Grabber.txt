Hi David,

Thanks for submitting your app for review. You've done great work and I commend your efforts!

Overall, I have recommended that your app be approved.

I've included detailed feedback and suggestions below, along with screenshots, which I hope will be helpful. 

Your screenshots and a downloadable version of this feedback are available at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6tkgrphke8iq9vu/AAAwMpAuppD5RsiuzISNz9Ava?dl=0. Please download them within one week, as I may remove them after that time.

Kind regards,
Joshua Harris, *Capstone Grader*
